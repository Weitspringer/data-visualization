Bad visualization No. 5:
The normalized stacked area chart is masked with the landmass of the USA (spatial mapping)
This complicates the reading of the chart for the user and furthermore distorts the data to match the shape 
(for example the values in the year 2060 are not vertically aligned; 
percentages of "Asian" and "Other" disappear completely in 2010). 

Bad visualization No. 7:
Image of the doctor has high visual complexity and is obsolete, the height of doctors 
can't be compared pairwise in an accurate manner with the human eye.
Additionally, the timeline is not linearly scaled. This was done so the images fit next to each other without overlapping, but distorts the timeline.

Bad visualization No. 9:
I discovered 3 aspects, but explain only 3) in detail:
1) Complex description of the axes
2) Line thickness used but not explained
3) x-axis not numerically scaled - it is unclear to the user which interval of the axis maps increase and decrease respectively. 
The user has to make an educated guess by reading the events.
Overall, the visualization is rather complex and not easy to read for laymen.

Bad visualization No. 10:
Minor aspect: 
1) Eye is same color as the specified color for a segment
Another issue: 
2) 1960: "Others" group is not visualized. The radius of segment for this group is probably too low
   and therefore can't be properly visualized with a pie chart. 
   Omitting the segment "Others" causes the impression that 1960 the population solely consists of 
   "Asians", "Blacks", "Hispanics" and "Whites". This is probably not true.
