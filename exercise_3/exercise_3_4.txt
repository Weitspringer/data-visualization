Bad visualization No. 5:
The normalized stacked area chart is masked with the landmass of the USA. 
This complicates the reading of the chart for the user and furthermore distorts the data to match the shape 
(for example the values in the year 2060 are not vertically aligned; 
percentages of "Asian" and "Other" disappear completely in 2010). 

Bad visualization No. 7:
Image of the doctor has high visual complexity and is obsolete, the height of pairwise doctors 
can't be compared accurately with the human eye.
Additionally, the timeline is not linearly scaled so the images fit next to each other without overlapping.

Bad visualization No. 9:
1) Wordy description of the axes
2) Thickness not explained but used
3) x-axis not numerically scaled - which side is increase, which is decrease (-> user has to guess)

Bad visualization No. 10:
1) Eye is same color as the specified color for a segment
2) 1960: 1% Asian or 1% other? Not clear, radius of segment for each group is too low
   and therefore can't be properly visualized.
