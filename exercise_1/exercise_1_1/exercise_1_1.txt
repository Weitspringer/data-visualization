1) Developers of new methods have to make clear why the needed information
cannot be extracted automatically and why the new method is better than existing methods.
Additionally, one has to take into account the context of the visualization and determine
if the visualization enables users to extract the relevant information from the data.

2) Negative knowledge can be produced if the visualization is wrong or misleading. 
The author explains this in the paper with an example where aliases lead to a wrong 
conclusion. Positive knowledge denotes a positive amount of knowledge gained from
the visualization (the visualization is correct and not misleading).

3) Based on the economic model proposed in section 3, a visualization is cnosidered to be
successful if it is "used by many people, who use it routinely to obtain highly valuable
knowledge, without having to spend time and money on hardware, software, and effort." 
[Wijk, p.423]. The model assumes a homogenous user community.

4) It is not directly measurable how much insight is acquired 
and the value of insight is difficult to assess.

5) The author proposes the aims for more generic insights at all levels:
Analyzing and categorizing methods (descriptive approach), evaluate and validate the methods,
propose models and laws (generic results), and further study methodological issues.
