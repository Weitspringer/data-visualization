Image 1:
The linear interpolation is misleading. The number of new cases does not increase linearily over time, but is measured in a single point in time (discrete).
Futhermore, a decrease in the line chart does not implicate a reduction in the total cases, but only a lower number of new cases in the next day.
This is negative, because the visualization contains a wrong statement at first sight and also implies an unrealistic time course.

Image 2:
Too many colors and their shades (i.e. California and Colorado are hard to separate). This is negative because the user has 
1) an information overload and 
2) could read the data in a wrong way (confusion of colors)

Image 3:
The visualization is badly scaled in y-direction. The difference between the two bars is exaggerated, even though the difference is only 0.107.
This is negative because the user has to carefully read the y-scale, but the attention is on the two bars first.

Image 4:
The aim was to represent the number of murders by firearms as a red mountain range.
However, by inverting the y-axis, the white area is perceived as a metaphor for a mountain range. 
This is negative because it first gives the impression that the number of murders increased in the 90s, which is not the case.
