d)
Statement 1: The average age of a person in the dataset is 23 years, the average height is 1.69 meters, 
and the average weight is 70 kg. This shows that the major population in the dataset is relatively young, for example.

Statement 2: The standard deviation of the height with a value of 0.0975554 indicates strong accumulation 
of the height values close to the mean height of ca. 1.69 meters.

Statement 3: The covariance of ca. 29.6 of age and weight values shows the tendency of a linear correlation 
of age and weight. Because the value of the covariance is positive, this means that greater age trends to higher weight.
